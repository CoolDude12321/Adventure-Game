# Adventure-Game
A Python-based text adventure game where the player explores different paths to find hidden treasure. Built using VS Code and GitHub Copilot, the game features interactive choices, branching story paths, and re-playable gameplay.

## Features
- Interactive command-line gameplay
- Multiple branching story paths
- Decision-based outcomes
- Replayable game loop with restart options
- Built using core python concepts
- Development assisted by GitHub Copilot in VS Code

## Technologies & Tools Used
- Programming Language : Python
- IDE : VS Code
- Extension : GitHub Copilot

## Game Concept
The game begins by greeting the player & asking for their name. From there, the player must choose between two starting paths:
- Explore a dark & magical forest
- Enter an ancient castle cave
Each path presents new choices that determines the final outcome. Depending on the player's decisions, the adventure may result in:
- Victory : discovering the hidden treasures
- Failure : making a poor decision that ends the journey
- Replay : choosing to restart the adventure
